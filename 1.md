# 1. Introduction

Running a binary executable file requires certain Shared Libraries (the .so files on Linux or .dll files on Windows) which have functions that are in compiled-form that the binary executable can call. And the executable doesn't require any source header files (like stdio.h) to run.

But, in order to *build* that executable, we do require header files and libraries that we can use in our source code and also a few libraries (having compiled code) that we can "link" to, or include them into our compilation process.

If you're familiar with Java, you might be aware of the development environment for Java called JDK (Java Development Kit) which includes libraries, tools (like compilers, debuggers etc.). Similarly, if we want to *build* an application in C, we need a development environment and that includes header files, libraries and various tools. 

For the libraries and header files, introducing the **C standard library**! 

## 1.1. C standard library

The C standard library or "libc" is the standard library for the C programming language, as specified in the ISO C standard.

The C standard library **defines** macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as string handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several other operating system services. The header files like "stdio.h", "stdlib.h" etc. that we come across when programming in C, are all *defined* in the C standard library!

Although C standard library is simply like a document that defines a standard, there are many different organizations that provide the **implementation** for the *C standard library*.

These implementations include:

 - **GNU C Library** (or **glibc**) for GNU/Linux OS
 - Microsoft **C Runtime Library** (**CRT**) for Windows
 - **Bionic** for Android from Google

...and many others.

These implementations contain all the header files defined by the standard and many of the functions in these implementations live in the compiled form (in the "object files").

## 1.2. Setting up the C development environment

If you're a GNU/Linux user, then you're lucky enough to have all the C development environment preinstalled on your system! This includes the tools like the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) that has the compiler, assembler, linker, debugger etc. You also have an implementation of the C standard library called the GNU C Library (glibc) preinstalled! All you have to do is create a C source file and start writing the code!

If you're a Windows user, you'll have to setup the C development environment manually. 

### 1.1.1. C development environment setup for Windows

Download Visual Studio Installer ("Visual Studio Community" edition [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)) and go to *Individual Components* tab and select the following 3 components. 

 1. **Windows 10 SDK** (Win32 API header files like "windows.h", standard C header files like "stdio.h" etc. and other libraries (having .lib extension) are installed with this.)
 2. **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools** (this gives us a few header files that the standard C headers on Windows depend on (like "vcruntime.h", "excpt.h" etc.), libraries, tools like dumpbin.exe, link.exe etc.).
 3. **C++ Clang Compiler for Windows** (Installs the Clang compiler)

Next, search for "*Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022*" in the search bar and this is where we get all the tools added to our local PATH and all the other env variables set in that CMD. 

If we want, we can install Windows 10 SDK, Clang compiler etc. independently by downloading each of the installers from their respective websites (like [this](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) for downloading the SDK installer, [this](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) for Clang installer) but when we try to compile a C file through CMD, we'll get errors saying "stdio.h not found" etc when compiling using Clang. Manually trying to setup C development environment on Windows is very tedious. Hence, it's better to use Visual Studio Installer and select only the required components mentioned above. Although Visual Studio Installer also installs the IDE with the above 3 components, we can choose to not use it and just compile all the files through CLI and use VS-Code or Notepad to type the C code.

If you want to add this *Developer Command Prompt* to VS Code, then open VS code, press `CTRL + ,` and it will open Settings. Open the Settings in JSON (there is an icon for that in the top-right corner just beside the split screen option), search for "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows" and paste the following inside that JSON:

```json
"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022": {
		"path": "${env:windir}\\System32\\cmd.exe",
		"args": ["/k", "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat"]
}
```

And you'll get a Developer Command Prompt in VS Code!

Also, just for your reference, all the standard header files are included in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include` after installing the Windows SDK. (On Linux, the header files are in `/usr/include`.)

As far as I tested, those are the minimum 3 components we need; to setup a C programming environment on Windows and installing them through Visual Studio Installer is very convenient.


## 1.3. Eagle's Eye view of the compilation process

When we write a C program and want to execute it, it basically goes through the following four stages before it becomes an executable that can be run by the Operating System.

 - **Stage 1: Preprocessing**: 
 
This stage is handled by the Preprocessor module of the compiler toolset. At this stage, all the Preprocessor Directives like `#include`, `#define` etc. are resolved. For example, `#include <stdio.h>` tells the Preprocessor to include all the contents of the `stdio.h` header file into our source code.

- **Stage 2: Compilation**:

Now, the C compiler takes the Preprocessor's output and compiles it to the Assembly language. If we're on an Intel or AMD CPU machine, then the Assembly language will be either x86 Assembly (for a 32-bit machine) or x86-64 Assembly (for a 64-bit machine). 

- **Stage 3: Assembling**:

This stage is handled by a special program called the Assembler (it is usually part of compiler itself but it can also be a separate program). 

The *Assembler* reads the Assembly file created by the compiler and it creates a binary file called an "object file" which contains machine-readable code and other metadata. But this binary file is still not in the executable form.

- **Stage 4: Linking**:

This is the last stage of the compilation process. And this stage is handled by a special program called the Linker. Again, this program can be part of the "GCC" but it can also be used as a separate program (`link.exe` on Windows and `ld` on Linux).

The purpose of a Linker is to try to resolve undefined function and global variable names. For example, until this stage, the compiler and the assembler aren't aware of function implementation of `printf()` because, `stdio.h` only contains the function definition but the function implementation lies somewhere in the library files. The Linker's task is to find where's the implementation for `printf()` is and put that into the final executable file. It similarly searches for other functions we've used in our source code and which are labelled as "External" in the header files that we've included. That's how Linker creates the final executable file that can be run by the OS!

**We'll discuss each of these compilation stages in detail in this study module!**
