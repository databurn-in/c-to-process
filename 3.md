# 2.3.1. Anatomy of an object file

An object file is a binary file that is meant to be given as an input to the Linker. Object files cannot be executed directly. 

The two important components of an object file are the *Sections* and the *Symbol Table*. We'll be exploring these two components in detail in this chapter.

Although we'll mainly be discussing COFF object files (the object file format for Windows), we will involve bits (ðŸ˜‰) and pieces of information related to ELF object file here and there but the overall concept of Compiling, Assembling, Linking and Loading remains the same for both Windows and Linux.

The COFF object file is structured in the following order internally:

 1. **Object file header** (contains metadata about the object file)
 2. **Section header** (contains metadata about all the Sections in the object file)
 3. **Sections** (this part contains the actual Sections)
 4. **Relocation Table** (contains the information about what changes the Linker needs to perform for the *symbols* in each Section)
 5. **Symbol Table** (contains a list of symbols and their information)
 6. **String Table** (this is just an extension to the Symbol Table)

![coff file structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/COFF-Structure.png)


The final executable file on Windows has the PE (Portable Executable) format which is simply a small extension to the COFF object file format that we'll be discussing in this chapter. On Linux, both the object file and the executable follow the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) format.

Understanding the object file *Sections* is important because the Linker will use these Sections to link several object files together to create an executable file and the *Program Loader* of the Operating System will use the *linked sections* in that executable file to determine the memory layout of the program before loading it into the memory. We'll explore more about this in future chapters.

## 2.3.1.1 Sections

A Section can be considered as an independent module inside an object file. 

A Section can be:
 - an executable code.
 - Initialized data (variables who have been assigned some value are stored in this type of Section).
 - Uninitialized data (variables who have NOT been assigned some value are stored in this type of Section).
 - some metadata related to Linking and Debugging.

Sections related to Linking and Debugging metadata are created and handled by the Assembler and the Linker but the Sections related to Executable code and Initialized and Uninitialized data can be created and handled by the programmer. 

An x86 Assembly programmer can define a Section using the `.section` Assembler Directive in their Assembly source code. And the Assembler will create that Section in the object file when it's compiling the Assembly source code into the object file. 

Here's an example of an x86 Assembly "Hello World" program on Linux:

`hello.asm`:
```
.global _start
.intel_syntax

.section MyCodeSection, "ax", @progbits
_start:
    # print hello world
    mov %eax, 4
    mov %ebx, 1 #file descriptor of STDOUT
    lea %ecx, [message]
    mov %edx, 13
    int 0x80

    # call the exit syscall 
    mov %eax, 1
    mov %ebx, 69
    int 0x80

.section MyDataSection, "a", @progbits
    message:
    .ascii "Hello World\n"

```
(To know how to compile and run the above Assembly, [here](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/c65a5f9720d2bc3ffc63f9f7f6b273dd)!)
(Also, don't worry if you don't understand how the above Assembly code works. Just concentrate on the Sections for now).

In the above source code, notice that we're defining two Sections using the `.section` directive: "MyCodeSection" and "MyDataSection". We can give any name to our Sections and it doesn't matter. What matters is, what flags we give to our Sections.

The syntax for `.section` Directive is as follows:

`.section name, "flags", @type`

For ELF executables, the possible flags and types that we can mention are:

flags:
`a`: Section is allocatable into the memory
`w`: Section is writable by the other Sections of the executable file
`x`: Section is executable (i.e., some machine-readable code lives within that Section)

types: 
`@progbits`: Section contains data
`@nobits`: Section does not contain data (i.e., section only occupies space)

So, in the above Assembly code, when we said:

`.section MyCodeSection, "ax", @progbits`

Here, we're telling the Assembler to create a Section called "MyCodeSection" in the object file and give "*Allocatable*" and "*Executable*" flags to this Section in this Section's header. 

Similarly, we have:

`.section MyDataSection, "a", @progbits`

which tells the Assembler to create a Section called "MyDataSection" in the object file and give only the "*Allocatable*" flag in it's Section Header. If you see in the above source code, the string "Hello World" lives in this Section.

Eventually, these Sections and their headers will be copied from the object file and will be placed into the executable file by the Linker.

And when the Operating System (OS) reads the "MyCodeSection" from the executable file, it knows that this Section needs to be allocated into the memory and the contents inside it need to be executed on the CPU. It knows all this because of the "Allocatable" and "Executable" flags that are mentioned in the Section Header of the "MyCodeSection". And because we've mentioned only the "Allocatable" flag for the "MyDataSection", that Section will only be placed into the memory but won't be executed even if it had any code inside it. But, we only have "Hello World" string in there so there's nothing to worry about and that string will be read by our code residing in the "MyCodeSection".

So, all that the OS cares about are these flags in the Section Header and it couldn't care less about the Section name.

But these are not the only two Sections that will be put into the executable file. There will be other Sections that will be created by the Assembler and the Linker.

Let's see what other Sections are included by the Assembler into the object file:

```
readelf --sections hello.o
```
(`readelf` tool is the Linux-version of `dumpbin`!)

Output:
```
There are 10 section headers, starting at offset 0x148:

  p (processor specific)
```

There are 7 new Sections that are created by the Assembler apart from the two that we've created! Amongst these seven, the first three are the ones that we'll be discussing right now.

#### `.text`, `.data` and `.bss` Sections!

Certain Section names are considered special by Assembler and the Linker. 

Let's take `.text` and `.data` Sections as an example. Whenever the Assembler sees `.text` Section in the Assembly source code, it automatically assigns "ax" flag to it. Similarly, if the Assembler sees `.data` Section in our Assembly source code, it assigns "aw" flag to it. And these flags cannot be changed for these Section names (if you do try to change the flags for, let's say, `.text` Section, by using the following: `.section .text, "axw", @progbits`, then you'll get the following warning from the Assembler: "`Warning: ignoring changed section attributes for .text`"). That's because, these Section names are treated as keywords by the Assembler and the Assembler assumes that `.text` Section will have executable code and `.data` Section will have readable and writable data. 

These specially treated Section names are called *Special Sections*. But there's nothing really special about them. It's just that they have some fixed set of flags attached to their names.

 The following 2 lines are equivalent in an Assembly source code!

`.section MyCodeSection, "ax", @progbits`

and 

`.section .text`

The first line is where we are creating a Section with our own custom name and in the second line, we're using the Special Section name and, the "ax" flag and "@progbits" type are automatically assigned to the `.text` Section by the Assembler. If you wanna verify, just take a look at the above `readelf` output again and check out the flags assigned for `.text` Section. But because we haven't defined `.text` Section in our Assembly source code, the size of the `.text` Section is zero in that `readelf` output.

In fact, the `.text`, `.data` and `.bss` Sections (whose headers were present in the object file) will be removed by the Linker from the final executable file because their sizes are zero in the object file.

`readelf --sections hello.elf`:

Output:

```
There are 14 section headers, starting at offset 0x31f8:

  p (processor specific)
```

But, .text, .data and .bss are not the only three Special Section names. There are many others. And both COFF and ELF object file formats define their own set of Special Sections. But remember, as we've discussed so far, there is nothing really special about these *Special Sections*. Their names are just associated with a predefined set of flags in the Section headers and we can create our own Sections with those same flags if we wanted to! And, Special Sections are "special" only to the Assembler and the Linker. The OS doesn't care! It only cares about the flags mentioned in the Section Headers!

You can find the full list of Special Sections of COFF object file here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#special-sections

And the full list of Special Sections of ELF object file here: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/specialsections.html

#### Naming Convention for Sections

There is a simple naming convention for how we should name our Sections. 

If we're creating our own Section names like "MyCodeSection" and "MyDataSection", then we shouldn't start those names with a `.` (dot) character. Although the Assembler won't create any warning or error if we name our Section as ".myCodeSection", it's not considered as a good practice because only the Special Section names and other Section names created by the Assembler and the Linker for placing certain metadata, will start with a dot character. It's just a naming convention.

#### "page.o" file Analysis

So far, we've discussed about the ELF file format to explain what Sections and Section Headers are. And the concept remains exactly the same for COFF object files on Windows!

Let's take a look at the `dumpbin` output of the **page.o** file.

`dumpbin page.o`

```
Dump of file page.o
File Type: COFF OBJECT
  Summary
           8 .bss
           0 .data
          2A .drectve
           A .llvm_addrsig
          2C .rdata
         2BC .text
```

The above output shows a summary of various Sections in **page.o** file and their total sizes (in Bytes and in Hexadecimal).

We know that **page.o** object file was generated by compiling the **page.s** Assembly source file by the Assembler.

If we search for each of those Sections in our [`page.s`](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/f46c501006a083bd302b166b4a92e3a7) Assembly source file, we will find `.text`, `.rdata`, and `.drectve` Sections but `.data`, `.bss` and `.llvm_addrsig` are not found. That means, `.data`, `.bss` and `.llvm_addrsig` Sections were added by the Assembler into the object file.

We already know that `.text` Section contains the executable code, `.data` Section contains the initialized data (in our **page.o** file, this Section has zero bytes as given in the `dumpbin` output) and `.bss` Section contains the uninitialized data (here it's initialized to zero by default by the Assembler when it's creating the **page.o** file).

`.rdata` Section contains initialized read-only data. That means, the executable code from the `.text` Section can only read but not write to the `.rdata` Section. And as explained earlier, this is governed by the flags set in the Section Header of the `.rdata` Section.

`.drectve` Section (called the "directive" Section) is usually compiler-generated (i.e., it's included in the **page.s** file by the C compiler when it's generating **page.s** file from **page.c** file). The C compiler adds some metadata for the Linker in this Section. The Linker will later remove this Section from the final executable file. 

`.llvm_addrsig` Section is included into the object file by Clang Assembler. It is unique to LLVM (and GCC will have it's own unique Sections when we compile with GCC). But I'm not exactly sure what this particular Section is used for yet. We can find more info on that [here](https://llvm.org/docs/Extensions.html#sht-llvm-addrsig-section-address-significance-table). It has to do something with the *Symbol Table*. 

### 2.3.1.2 Symbol Table

An object file contains a Symbol Table as shown in the COFF file structure diagram below.

![coff file structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/COFF-Structure.png)

A Symbol Table in an object file is created by the Assembler and is particularly useful for the Linker. The purpose of a Symbol Table is to let the Linker know all the information it needs for linking a given object file with other object files.

All object files contain a Symbol Table in them but those Symbol Tables may or may not be retained in the final executable file created by the Linker (if the *Debug* option is set in the Linker, then the Symbol Table will be retained in the executable file, but otherwise, it won't be retained).

But what actually constitutes as a "symbol"?

Well, any string that the Linker needs to identify when it's reading an object file. A "symbol" (in the term "Symbol Table") can be a Section name (which the Linker might include into the final executable), a function name (which the Linker needs to resolve if the function isn't implemented within the object file itself, like the `printf()` function), global variables (which the Linker needs to make them accessible to other object files) etc.

**Symbol Table of "page.o" file:**

Let's explore how a Symbol Table of a COFF object file looks like.

To view the Symbol Table of **page.o** file, we can use the following command:

`dumpbin /symbols page.o`

Here is the output:

```
Dump of file page.o

```
Let's try to understand what the above `dumpbin` output says! It looks very complex but it really isn't once we understand the concept :)

So, in a Symbol Table of a COFF object file, there are two types of records:

 1. Primary symbol table record
 2. Auxiliary symbol table record

Primary symbol table record contains all the important information related to a symbol. And the auxiliary record contains metadata for the symbol given in that primary record!

*A primary record has **zero or more** auxiliary records associated with it.* 

And both, the primary records and the auxiliary records, are shown in the `dumpbin` output.

The `dumpbin` Symbol Table output is in the following format:

```
{index} {relocatable-address} {section-number} {simple-data-type}{complex-data-type} {storage-class} | {symbol-name}
	{auxiliary record related to the above primary record}
```

So now we can interpret the first record of the Symbol Table of **page.o**:

```
000 00000000 SECT1  notype       Static       | .text
    Section length   38, #relocs    3, #linenums    0, checksum 8344F462
```

The first row is the primary record and the second row is the auxiliary record providing metadata (for the `.text` Section in this example).

**Primary record format**:
```
{index} {relocatable-address} {section-number} {simple-data-type}{complex-data-type} {storage-class} | {symbol-name}
```

`{index}`: A unique identifier for each *primary record* of the Symbol Table.

`{relocatable-address}`: Address at which the related Section needs to be placed. Default is 0 and will be determined by the Linker/Loader at a later stage.

`{section-number}`: This column tells us the Section in which given the symbol exists. Examples are SECT1, SECT2 SECT3 etc. and these names are also defined in the first few records of the same Symbol Table. And if the given symbol is not defined in the object file, then this column value will have the  UNDEF value and the Linker needs to resolve it later. 

`{simple-data-type}`: This column says the data type of the symbol. That is, whether the symbol is an integer, a floating-point, and so on. If the symbol doesn't have a type (i.e., if it's a Section or a function), then this column has `notype` value in the dumpbin output.

`{complex-data-type}`: This column says whether the symbol is a pointer, function, array or none of that. If it's a function, dumpbin denotes it with a `()` characters. If it's a Section, then this column will be blank.

`{storage-class}`: This column says whether the symbol is visible outside of the object file or not. If it's `Static` then the symbol is visible only within the object file. If it's `External` then the symbol is visible externally to other object files and hence linkable to other object files.

`{symbol-name}`: This column gives the actual name of the symbol. 

**Auxiliary record format:**
More info on the Auxiliary record formats can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#auxiliary-symbol-records

For the above example, refer this link for the Auxiliary record format: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#auxiliary-format-5-section-definitions

**Now please go back to the dumpbin Symbol Table output shown previously and try to interpret information given there.** We might not understand everything in that output but we will understand it later when we cover the Linker topic in the next chapter. But so far we've covered the primary and auxiliary records of the Symbol Table and how to interpret the Symbol Table output of dumpbin.

#### String Table

You can think of the String Table as an extension to the Symbol Table. The String Table contains the symbol names that are too long to be held in the Symbol Table. If a symbol name is more than 8 characters long, then it is stored in the String Table and a reference to that String Table entry is stored in the Symbol Table.

The structure of the COFF String Table is as follows:

- At the beginning of the COFF String Table are 4 bytes that contain the total size (in bytes) of the rest of the string table. This size includes the size field itself, so that the value in this location would be 4 if no strings were present.

- Following the size are null-terminated strings that are pointed to by symbols in the COFF Symbol Table.

You cannot explicitly view the String Table using `dumpbin` because `dumpbin` always resolves all the String Table references in the Symbol Table and shows all the Symbol Table and String Table results with the */symbols* option itself! (`dumpbin /symbols page.o`) 

Also, it is important to note here that certain symbol names are in *decorated* format. For example, we can see a string like "*??_C@_0CM@FNBKJMLD@The?5page?5size?5for?5this?5system?5is@*" in the above Symbol Table of **page.o** file. That string looks like "*The page size for this system is %u bytes.\n*" string we used in our **page.c** source code. Certain string values, function names, global variable names etc. are in a "decorated" format in the Symbol Table (or rather, in the String Table, if the symbol name is more than 8 characters long). Know more about *Decorated Names* here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/decorated-names

In short, the Compiler creates these "Decorated Names" in the Assembly source file to help the Linker resolve certain symbols.

### Recap

So far, we have covered 2 main components of the an object file: 

 1. Sections (and their headers) 
 2. Symbol Table (and the String Table)

But you might have observed that we still haven't covered the "Relocation Table" shown in the above COFF file structure. That will be covered in the next chapter. We'll also learn how the Linker uses the Symbol Table and the Relocation Information and how it creates an executable file.
