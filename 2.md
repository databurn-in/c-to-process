# 2. Compilation Stages

`page.c`:
```c
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <windows.h>

int  main(void){
	SYSTEM_INFO si;
	GetSystemInfo(&si);
	printf("The page size for this system is %u bytes.\n", si.dwPageSize);
	return  0;
}
```

We need to understand how the above code gets compiled, loaded into memory, and executed to print the output of the `page size` of the system.

Thus, our goal is to understand the entire workflow of how a source code turns into a *Process* in the Operating System.

## 2.1. Stage 1: Preprocessing

The first stage of compilation is Preprocessing. In a C source code, anything that starts with a `#` is called a *Preprocessor Directive*. This includes `#include`, `#define` etc.

Preprocessor is an independent component of the C compilation toolset and it scans our source file and does necessary changes to it before passing it to the C compiler. And by including the *Preprocessor Directives*, we're instructing the Preprocessor about what needs to be done to our source file. For example, when we say `#include <stdio.h>`, we're telling the Preprocessor to "include" the contents of a file called 'stdio.h' into our source code. 

But how will the Preprocessor know where to find those header files?

On Windows, Clang compiler will have a few directory paths configured to search for header files. If we want to get the preprocessed output and also view the paths that Clang searches for (for header files), we can do the following: 

```bash
C:\Users\teles\Desktop\C>clang -v -E page.c > preprocessor-output.txt

```

`-E` switch is to view the Preprocessed output and `-v` is for verbose output. And you can see all the paths where Clang searched for the standard C header files in the above logs.

The Preprocessor Output will be a lengthy text file whose initial few lines look something like this:
(the file is truncated and that is indicated by dots(`.`))
```c

               wchar_t const* _FileName,

```
(**View the complete preprocessed output [here](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/a3f6304d1dc331ca865a02aba70e80aa)**.)

In the above Preprocessor output, we can still see multiple lines that start with `#`. Aren't they supposed to be the Preprocessor Directives? Well, yes! But in the above case, no. The above output is an intermediate file meant to be seen by the compiler. When we included stdio.h file, we also indirectly included all the other header files that are included inside stdio.h! As the Preprocessor needs to include all the contents of stdio.h and it's dependencies into our source file, the line numbers of our code and that of the header file code changes. If in case of compilation errors, the compiler needs the original line numbers of our source file to generate meaningful error messages referring to the correct line numbers and not the line numbers of the preprocessed source file (and for your reference, in our example, the page.c file has only 9 total lines and the preprocessed output of that file has 113,061 lines! That is the amount code *included* by the Preprocessor!). That's why, the Preprocessor writes several lines in the following format before *pasting* any code from a different file:

    # line-number filename flags


In the following code snippet from the Preprocessor output:

```c
# 278 "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\include\\10.0.18362.0\\ucrt\\corecrt.h" 3
             void __cdecl _invalid_parameter_noinfo(void);
         __declspec(noreturn) void __cdecl _invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn(void);

__declspec(noreturn)
         void __cdecl _invoke_watson(
               wchar_t const* _Expression,
               wchar_t const* _FunctionName,
               wchar_t const* _FileName,
               unsigned int _LineNo,
               uintptr_t _Reserved);
```

the Preprocessor is telling the compiler that the above C code snippet is from a header file called `corecrt.h` and that code snippet can be found at *line number 278* in that original header file. The *flag 3* indicates that the `corecrt.h` is a system header file and not a user-defined header file.

And the above code snippet started at line number 72 in the preprocessor output file but if there is any error in that code snippet, the compiler will say the error was in line number 278 in corecrt.h file and not at line number 72 of the preprocessor output file.

## 2.2. Stage 2: Compilation

 Compilation is basically a translation process. In our case, the C compiler translates C code to Assembly code. 

In Clang, we can get the compilation output (i.e., C to Assembly) using the `-S` switch. 

`clang -S page.c`

That command will create the output file `page.s` which contains the Assembly translation for our C code.

Since we are using Windows on an x64 (64-bit Intel CPU) machine, the C code is translated into *x86-64 Assembly* language on our system.

Covering *x86-64 Assembly* language is outside the scope of this post. So, just to summarize, Intel CPU chips have several Registers and they can be referenced with standard names in the x86-64 Assembly language. So, we have general purpose registers like eax, ebx, ecx, edx etc. and special purpose registers like eip (instruction pointer), ebp (stack base pointer), esp (stack pointer) etc.

To move data to and from these Registers and the Memory, and to do a lot of other low-level tasks with the CPU, we have several CPU instructions. The whole collection of these instructions is called as an *Instruction Set*. CPUs of different architectures have their own Instruction Sets. For example, Intel has it's own Instruction Set and ARM chips (which are mostly used on mobile phones) have their own Instruction Sets. 

A few example instructions from the Instruction Set for x86-64 chips (Intel) are:
**mov** instruction is to move a value into the register
**lea** instruction is to load effective address into the register. Used when dealing with memory operations in Intel.
**int** is the interrupt call, 0x80 is the kernal interrupt

x86-64 Assembly code can by written in two types of syntax: **Intel** and **AT&T** syntax.

One visible difference you might see when you compare Intel and AT&T syntax is that, in AT&T syntax, we have a few suffixes and prefixes to some instructions and Register names. For example, you might see `movl` instead of `mov` instruction in AT&T syntax. `movl` instruction asks the CPU to *move* a *Long* (an integer) into the register, `movb` which asks the CPU to *move* a *Byte* into a register etc.. In Intel syntax, we only have the `mov` instruction and the Assembler will try to figure out the *type* and other stuff. 

A summary of differences in Intel and AT&T syntax is as shown below:


<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Intel</th>
<th>AT&amp;T</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Comments</td>
<td><code>;</code></td>
<td><code>//</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Instructions</td>
<td>Untagged <code>add</code></td>
<td>Tagged with operand sizes: <code>addq</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Registers</td>
<td><code>eax</code>, <code>ebx</code>, etc.</td>
<td><code>%eax</code>,<code>%ebx</code>, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Immediates</td>
<td>0x100</td>
<td>$0x100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indirect</td>
<td><code>[eax]</code></td>
<td><code>(%eax)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General indirect</td>
<td><code>[base + reg + reg * scale + displacement]</code></td>
<td><code>displacement(reg, reg, scale)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Source: https://staffwww.fullcoll.edu/aclifton/courses/cs241/syntax.html

In my case, the compiler was configured to produce the Assembly code in AT&T syntax by default. 

We can choose the syntax using the `-masm` switch in Clang.

If we want the compiler to produce the x86-64 Assembly in Intel syntax, we can use the following command:
`clang -masm=intel -S page.c`


The truncated version of **page.s** file in AT&T syntax (`-masm=att` switch) is as shown below:

```asm
.
.
.
	pushl	%ebp
	movl	%esp, %ebp
	pushl	%esi
	subl	$24, %esp
	movl	12(%ebp), %eax
	movl	8(%ebp), %eax
.
.
. 
(a total of 384 lines)
```

The same portion of code in Intel syntax (`-masm=intel` switch) is as shown below:
```asm
.
.
.
	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp
	push	esi
	sub	esp, 24
	mov	eax, dword ptr [ebp + 12]
	mov	eax, dword ptr [ebp + 8]
.
.
.
(a total of 385 lines)
```

(View the complete "page.s" file in Intel syntax [here](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/f46c501006a083bd302b166b4a92e3a7).)

#### Assembler Directives

In the `page.s` file, apart from the x86-64 Assembly Instructions, we also see keywords like `.def`, `.type`, `.scl`, `.section` etc.. These are called *Assembler Directives*. Just like we have Preprocessor Directives (like `#include`, `#define` etc.) while writing a C program, we have Assembler Directives while writing an Assembly program using which we can tell the Assembler how we want it to compile our Assembly source code. More about Assembler Directives [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gas-2.9.1/html_chapter/as_7.html).

There is an excellent tutorial that introduces x86 Assembly! Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDiaZS-2ok

## 2.3. Stage 3: Assembly


Until this stage, the Assembly instructions are still in textual (Human-readable) format. This text file (in our example, the page.s file) needs to be converted into a different format that the CPU can decode and execute our instructions. We can't feed a few lines of *String* type to the hardware.

If we want to convert the Assembly text file into a machine-readable binary, we need to use a special program called an *Assembler*. And the binary file that the Assembler produces at this stage is called as an *Object* file (**doesn't refer to the 'Object' in an object-oriented language**).

In Clang, we can use `-c` switch to create the Object file. But this option takes the C source file as an input and goes from Stage 1 to Stage 3 (current stage) to produce the Object file.

The below command produces the Object file.

`clang -c page.c`

The output of the above command will be **page.o** file.

We can also use an Assembler directly. There is a program called `as` (GNU Assembler) which takes an Assembly source code file as an input and produces the Object file. More on [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/).

Apart from the machine-readable version ("binary version") of our Assembly code, the object file *may* contain metadata used for linking or debugging, including: information to resolve symbolic cross-references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information. Other metadata may include the date and time of compilation, the compiler name and version, and other identifying information. We'll learn more about these later.

**What's the file format of the object file?**

Under Linux, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler will generate files with a .o extension which use the ELF (**Executable and Linkable Format**) format. Compilation on Windows generates files with a .obj (or .o)  extension which use the COFF (**Common Object File Format**) format.

(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file)

**How to view the headers and content of the object file?**

As mentioned earlier, on Windows, the object file is in COFF format. To view the headers and other info of a COFF object file, we can use the `dumpbin` utility on Windows (and that comes installed with Visual Studio and accessible through the Developer Command Prompt). On Linux, we have the `readelf` utility.

Executing `dumpbin page.o` will give us the following output:

```cmd
C:\Users\teles\Desktop\C>dumpbin page.o 
Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 14.31.31104.0
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

Dump of file page.o
File Type: COFF OBJECT
  Summary
           8 .bss
           0 .data
          2A .drectve
           A .llvm_addrsig
          2C .rdata
         2BC .text
```

And, we'll get a whole lot more information about our object file if we use the `/all` switch (the `dumpbin /all page.o` command). 

**You can view the entire output of `dumpbin /all page.o` command [here](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/c36710e6c74ed1259b2ebe17c949c9a5)!**

In the above `dumpbin` output, we see a summary of a few things like `.bss`, `.data`, `.text` etc. What are those? Those are not Assembler Directives (even though they look like Assembler Directives because the names start with a dot (`.`)). Those are called 'Sections' of an object file. And what are 'Sections'?
