# 3. Process Creation

The following diagram shows various stages that occur when we run an exe file. Whenever an exe is to be executed, a process needs to call the [CreateProcess()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) function. The caller of this function becomes a Parent process and the newly executed exe through `CreateProcess()` becomes the Child Process of the Parent. Each of these stages are not discussed in this chapter. ***[Windows Internals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/resources/windows-internals)*** book is an excellent resource for understanding many of the Operating System basics. You can refer to **Chapter 5: Processes, Threads and Jobs** chapter of that book to understand each of these stages in depth. You can find the sample version of that book here from Microsoft: https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/4/0/14045a9e-c978-47d1-954b-92b9fd877995/97807356648739_samplechapters.pdf

I have referred to ***Image Loader*** section found in ***Chapter 3: System Mechanisms*** and some sections of ***Chapter 5: Processes, Threads and Jobs*** of ***Windows Internals*** book to create these notes. 

We'll be discussing Image Loader (or simply, the "Loader" or "Program Loader" or sometimes referred to as "Dynamic Linker") in detail in this chapter (and Image Loader is invoked by a kernel thread in Stage 7 that's shown in the above diagram)!

The following description is what happens at Stage 7 that's shown in the above diagram.

## 3.1. The Loader Flow

When an exe is running, it's called as a *Process*. When a process is started on the system, the kernel creates a process object to represent it and performs various kernel-related initialization tasks. An "object" here refers to the data structure to store metadata and various types of information related to a process. Most of these process objects are created in kernel-mode and are stored in the kernel address space. However, these tasks merely result in the preparation of the process's context and environment and do not result in the execution of the application. The actual initialization of the execution of an exe is done in user-mode and this work is performed by the **Image Loader**, also referred to as *Ldr* in internal Microsoft documentation.

The image loader lives in the user-mode system DLL **ntdll.dll** and not in the kernel library. Therefore, it behaves just like standard code that is part of a DLL, and it is subject to the same restrictions in terms of memory access and security rights. What makes this code special is the guaranty that it will always be present in the running process (Ntdll.dll is always loaded) and that it is the first piece of code to run in user mode as part of a new application.

On Windows, a process needs at least one *Thread* to do anything. A thread is an execution context in a process. A thread is what executes the code and not the process. When the first thread of a process is born, the kernel prepares the thread for execution and runs `LdrInitializeThunk()` function (found in ntdll.dll) in this thread. And `LdrInitializeThunk()` is our Loader function! And yes! The loader actually runs in the thread of our process! This Loader function then goes on to call other functions that read the exe, load it's Sections onto the memory, load DLLs mentioned in the Import Table of the exe, setup the Heap etc.

Next, `RtlUserThreadStart()` is executed and that function uses the *AddressOfEntryPoint* field in the Optional Headers of the exe to call the entry point of the exe and that's how our process begins it's actual execution!

Let's deep dive into how the Loader goes through Import and Export Tables.

### 3.1.1. Loading the DLLs

#### 3.1.1.1. Step 1: Reading the Import Table of the exe

The first step that the Loader takes is going through the Import Directory Table (IDT). From the IDT entries, the Loader gets to know what DLL files are to be loaded into the memory but it currently doesn't know what symbols to look for in each of those DLLs. The Loader gets Hint-Name Table address (through Import Lookup Table (ILT) because ILT contains the RVA of each of the entries in Hint-Name Table as shown in the diagram below).

![Import Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/import-table-explanation-2.png)

The *Hint-Name Table* (or simply, the *Name Table*) contains two main columns, Export Table Hint and Import Symbol name. The Export Table Hint is an index of the Export Name Pointer Table of a DLL. But this hint index is not always accurate (and I don't know why). For example, the Export Name Pointer Table index for "GetSystemInfo" in kernel32.dll is 0x02E6 but the Hint value recorded by the Linker in the Hint-Name Table for this symbol is 0x02E3. You can see and compare these values yourself from the dumpbin out of [Import Tables of page.exe](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/28c7fd5b8243901ec97eeec9f9006696) and [Export Tables of kernel32.dll](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/4252a663998799b702014aba66786247).

According to the description given in the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#hintname-table), the Loader first attempts to find our symbol in the Export Tables with the "hint" given in the Hint-Name Table of the Import Tables. If the symbol name at the "hint" index of Export Name Pointer Table doesn't match with the name for the hint in Hint-Name Table, then Loader simply does a binary search for the symbol name in the Export Name Pointer Table to find our symbol. That's why I think it's called as a "hint" and not as an "index". It simply gives a hint to the Loader and not the exact index where it can find the symbol in the Export Tables.

#### 3.1.1.2. Step 2: Reading the Export Table of the DLL

As described earlier, the Loader gets a hint from the Hint-Name Table for the symbol and it goes to the Export Name Pointer Table of the DLL to see what's the symbol name at that hinted index. If the symbol name given in Export Name Pointer Table at that hinted index doesn't match with the symbol name given in Hint-Name Table, then Loader does a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) of the entire Export Name Pointer Table of the DLL to search for our symbol name mentioned in Hint-Name Table.

![Export Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/export-tables.png)


Once the Loader finds the required symbol in the Export Name Pointer Table, it notes the index where it found that symbol (in the above diagram, the index is 0x2E6 for "GetSystemInfo" symbol). It uses this same index to get the ordinal value from Export Ordinal Table. 

Export Ordinal Table contains a list of indices (called *ordinals*) into the Export Address Table. The Loader finds the appropriate index of the Export Address Table through the Export Ordinal Table as shown in the above diagram. 

Export Address Table contains the RVA of the symbol that the Loader is searching for.

The actual Virtual Address of the symbol is generated by *adding* the Base Virtual Address of the DLL (where it's loaded) *plus* the RVA of the symbol.


#### 3.1.1.3. Step 3: Adding entries into the Import Address Table (IAT)

Once the Loader gets the Virtual Address of the target symbol, it updates this information into the IAT of the process (and as exe is being loaded into the memory, it's now a process and its IAT will be in memory and that's where the Loader updates the information).

The Loader follows these steps with each of the DLLs mentioned in the IDT of the exe. The Loader also needs to load other DLLs that are mentioned in the Import Tables of DLLs. This whole procedure is thus, recursive.

And that's how the Loader loads the DLLs for the exe and updates the IAT!

 
### 3.1.2. Loading the Sections of exe into memory


Here, we'll discuss the memory structure of our process and how the Sections (like **.text**, **.data**, **.bss** etc. are loaded into the virtual address space of the process).

We can visualize the entire virtual address space of page.exe below:

![page.exe VMMap screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/page-exe-vmmap.png)

(The above screenshot is taken from [VMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/vmmap) tool (VMMap stands for Virtual Memory Map).)

When we launch page.exe, and when it starts executing, the entire virtual address space (including all the Sections of page.exe, DLL files, Heap, Stack etc.) are shown above.

Covering each of the terms and numbers in the above screenshot is outside the scope of this study module. You can get more info on it in this talk by Mark Russinovich (the original creator of VMMap and many other tools) : https://youtu.be/TrFEgHr72Yg?t=1767

The Header (including MS-DOS Stub, PE File Signature, COFF File Header, Optional Header and Section Header) are loaded into the virtual memory. Each Section is loaded into the virtual memory according to the RVA mentioned in Section Headers. You can view the page.exe Headers [here](https://gist.github.com/NandanDesai/f8e02bc891f807e1eafe66ec35b4a546). We can see in those headers that the RVA of .text Section is 0x1000 and the virtual size is 0xD90 bytes. And as the Base Address of the loaded exe as seen from the VMMap screenshot is 0x00DE0000, the Loader will align the .text Section in such a way that it starts at the address 0x00DE1000 as shown in the diagram below. You can similarly compare how the Headers, and other Sections are aligned in the virtual address space according to what RVA is mentioned in the headers.

![page.exe virtual address space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandanDesai/res/master/programs-and-processes/process-virtual-address-space.png)

- **.data** has initialized global and static variables.
- Stack has all the local variables defined in a function or any parameters passed to a function. And each Thread has it's own stack. And even though we didn't create any multiple threads, we can see some other Thread Stacks in the VMMap output. I think those other Thread Stacks are related to DLLs but not sure. Maybe you can try to find out!
- Any memory requested through functions like `malloc()` will be allocated from Heap.
- Any strings defined in our program will be stored in **.rdata**. And of course, **.rdata** will have Import Tables and other Data Directories as explained in previous chapter!

page.exe process's Virtual Address space also has all the required DLLs as seen from the VMMap screenshot. The above diagram explains how the Sections, Stack, Heap and DLLs are aligned in the page.exe's Virtual Memory.

But of course, all of the Virtual Memory isn't actually allocated in the Physical Memory. Even though page.exe's Virtual Memory might look huge with all the DLLs loaded, those DLLs are allocated only once in Physical Memory and are mapped to each process's Virtual Memory as required. And there is Paging done. 


## Conclusion

This study module ends here. 

There are many related concepts like how the Stack and Heap exactly work, Threads, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Protection (DEP), Fragmentation in Virtual Memory due to ASLR, Memory counters like Private Bytes, Working Set etc. that are not covered in this study module. I might write some material on these topics in future so stay tuned!
